# _blsh - The Brian Lee shell v0.01_

#### _a small shell written in c#, Winter/Spring 2019_


### Notes and questions

## ToDo
* method that takes filename as an agument and checks if it exists.
    * there are now several external files that need to be checked, so it needs to be DRYd up
* arrow up for history
    * enumerate branch has a beginning of this feature.

## Finished
* _Basic Loop in Main()_
* _Simple ls application to test blsh_
* _handles builtins using delegates_
* _Create ini file_

## Current Built-Ins
* clear
* pwd 
* whoami
* cd 
* history

## Current Externals
* ls (outputs needs cleanup)
* mkdir
* touch

## Known Bugs
