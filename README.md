# _blsh - The Brian Lee shell_

#### _a small proof of concept shell written in c#, Winter/Spring 2019_

### The initial goal of _blsh_ is to make a basic shell that would be capable of reading commands and executing them with arguments.  My intenetion was to build something simple to see if it was something that would be relevant with tasking my C# students with doing.

## ToDo
* _Create ini file_
  *
* _start adding built-ins_
* _Read MacOS native bash commands and .exe through mono. currently only runs .exe(simple fix)_
* _Change the name of the method DoesItExist_
*


## Finished
* _Basic Loop in Main()_
* _Simple ls application to test blsh_
* _Removed dictionary, now just searches bin folder for binaries, handles exception if does not exist_

## Built-In
